## Releases and Records

There are two kinds of OCDS document:

<table>
    <tr>
        <td width="50%" align="center"><img src="../../../assets/green_release.svg.png" width="50%"></td>
        <td width="50%" align="center"><img src="../../../assets/green_compilation.svg.png" width="50%"></td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
<td valign="top" style="padding:10px;" markdown=1>

**Releases** provide updates on each event in a contracting process, ideally in real-time. They can be used to notify users of new tenders, awards, contracts and other updates. One contracting process can have many releases.

**Records** aggregate all the releases available for a contracting process at a given time. There ought to be only be one record per contracting process.

    </tr>
</table>

### Releases

Releases are immutable â€“ presenting information about a particular event in the lifetime of a contracting process. The release `id` needs to be changed whenever the value of another field in the release is changed.

Each release needs to contain an `ocid`, a unique release `id` and a release `tag`, and ought to contain as much information as can be provided for users to understand the event taking place.

For example: 

* A 'planning' release can provide information in the `planning` section about budgets and procurement intention, and the `tender` section about the proposed details for a future tender;
* A 'tender' release can provide information in the `tender` section about how to bid for the work, and can repeat `planning` section information on the budget or project the tender is associated with;
* A 'tenderUpdate' release can provide an updated `tender` section with links to documents that answer questions asked during the enquiry period;
* An 'award' release can provide details of the supplier awarded the contract in the `award` section, and can provide repeated information about the how procurement took place in the `tender` section;
* A 'contract' release can provide the details of the signed contract in a `contract` section, matched with a related `award` section;
* An 'implementationUpdate' release can repeat details of the `contract`, and provide information on milestones achieved and payments to the supplier, or can update the contract `implementation` section with links to newly published documents. 

You can think of **releases** as entries into a ledger: each new entry adds information. Each entry can also repeat the previous information that remains true. 

#### Examples


```eval_rst

.. jsoninclude:: ../examples/planning.json
   :jsonpointer: /releases
   :expand: releases, planning, tag, documents

```

```eval_rst

.. jsoninclude:: ../examples/tender.json
   :jsonpointer: /releases
   :expand: releases, tender, items, tag, documents

```

```eval_rst

.. jsoninclude:: ../examples/tenderUpdate.json
   :jsonpointer: /releases
   :expand: releases, tender, tag, documents

```


```eval_rst

.. jsoninclude:: ../examples/award.json
   :jsonpointer: /releases
   :expand: releases, awards, value, suppliers, items, contractPeriod, tag, documents

```

```eval_rst

.. jsoninclude:: ../examples/contract.json
   :jsonpointer: /releases
   :expand: releases, contracts, period, value, items, tag, documents

```


```eval_rst

.. jsoninclude:: ../examples/implementation.json
   :jsonpointer: /releases
   :expand: releases, contracts, implementation, transactions, tag, documents

```

#### Best practices

In some cases, releases will all come from the same backend system. In others, they will be generated by different systems. By ensuring all releases about a contracting process share an `ocid`, they can be tied together into a record. 

In a complete OCDS implementation, each release would be published at its own persistent URL, and kept online permanently. 

In some cases, a publisher might only have the data infrastructure to publish and iteratively update one release for each contracting process. If so, the release `id` and release `date` need to be modified with each update. A suggested pattern for generating a unique release `id` is to append an incrementing number to the end of the `ocid`: for example, if the `ocid` is "ocds-a2ef3d01-1594121", then each sequential release `id` can be:

* ocds-a2ef3d01-1594121/1
* ocds-a2ef3d01-1594121/2
* ocds-a2ef3d01-1594121/3

Other possible approaches are to append the date or timestamp of the last data change to the `ocid` (if any is saved in the source system(s)) or to use a hash of the release data to generate an unique suffix. The [implementation guidance](../implementation/easy-releases.md) has detailed examples of both strategies.

### Records

An OCDS **record** provides a snapshot of the contracting process at a given point in time, bringing together all the information from the releases to date into one place. It is updated as new information becomes available.

At a minimum, a record ought to exist for each contracting process, to provide a list of all the releases that relate to that contracting process.

However, to allow users to get a snapshot view the contracting process without individually looking up each release, a record ought to also contain:

* a compiled release, which expresses the current state of the contracting process, by showing only the most recent field values
* a versioned release, which expresses all historical states of the contracting process, by showing all the field values over time

The [merging documentation](../schema/merging) set out how to combine multiple releases to create a single record for each contracting process.

```eval_rst

.. jsoninclude:: ../examples/record.json
   :jsonpointer: 
   :expand: compiledRelease, tender, award, contracts, implementation, transactions, tag, documents

```
