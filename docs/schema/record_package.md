## Record Package Schema

The record package schema describes the structure of the container for publishing records. The contents of a record are based on the release schema. The package contains important metadata.

You can view an interactive version of the record schema below (requires JavaScript) or [download this version of the schema here](../../record-package-schema.json).

A separate, auto-generated [versioned release schema](../../versioned-release-validation-schema.json) is provided for validating versioned releases within records.

For this version of OCDS, the canonical URL for the record package schema is <https://standard.open-contracting.org/schema/1__1__4/record-package-schema.json> and for the versioned release schema is <https://standard.open-contracting.org/schema/1__1__4/versioned-release-validation-schema.json>

Using the canonical URL guarantees that your software, documentation or other resources will always refer to the specific version of the schema with which they were authored and tested.
